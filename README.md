# pong-clone

This is a collaborative learning-focused project for beginning CS students at Wright State. If you want to join in:

1. Install the jdk, git, and whatever programming IDE or text editor you want (see here for instructions: https://github.com/mkijowski/wsu-cs-remote-setup)

2. Get a GitHub account (these are free). Consider choosing a professional-ish sounding username.

3. Fork this project (the fork button is in the upper right corner of this page). This creates a copy of the repository within your own GitHub account for you to work on independently, so that multiple developers can be working on different parts of the application at the same time.

4. Clone your fork to your local system by opening up a terminal and using this command: `git clone <REPOSITORY_URL>`  You can find the repository URL by clicking on the green "Code" button.

5. Pick an issue from the "Issues" list at the top of this page that you'd like to work on and post a comment saying that you want to give it a shot. I will then put you in as the assignee.

6. Play around with the code and fix/implement the issue you picked. NOTE: We're writing Pong here. This is a *very* low-stakes development project. Don't worry if you don't understand all aspects of the code -- just play around with it and see what you can do.

7. When you think you have finished the issue, *test your work locally*.

8. Once you feel good about it, commit your work to your forked version of the repo. You can use these commands:

  * `git commit -a`
  * This opens a text editor. Type in a commit message explaining what you did and then save it. Be sure to reference the issue number in your commit message (i.e. "fixes/implements issue #4").
  * `git push`
  
9. Finally, generate a pull request (the link for this is at the top of your forked repository page).

Happy hacking!!
